#### Contest Details:

**Unlock(): Forging Keys Towards the Doors of the Future** is the flagship week-long event of PUP The Programmers’s Guild (TPG), blending storytelling,creativity, and technology into a transformative, and reflective experience.

Hosted by **PUP The Programmers' Guild (PUP TPG)** is a non-academic organization affiliated with the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP)

#### Contest Theme:

**Unlock()** revolves around the core idea that _**“Keys are not given, they are forged through trials.”**_ While the event provides guiding metaphors such as keys, doors, and realms, these are not limitations. Instead, they are launch points for creativity.

**Interpret the theme in unique and personal ways**. A _“door”_ can symbolize opportunity, failure, or even memory. A _“key”_ can represent courage, resilience, or collaboration.
